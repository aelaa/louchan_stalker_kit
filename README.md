Stalker kit for some people's SNS

My friend Lou is a kind of strange. I care about her, and I want to check some of her SNS more,
than it's default clients can.

This repo contains:

* twitter_feed - once in a 20 seconds check her twitter for the last tweet
(sure she cannot type faster). It saves even deleted tweets.
Soon it will tag deleted tweets and save in some readable and searchable format.

* https://github.com/aelaa/vk_status - checking for Vkontakte SNS status
